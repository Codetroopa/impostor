Machine Learning Model for AI:
  Feature Set:
	- Position on map (x, y)
	- Time (ms? 10ms? every frame?)
	- Time since last direction change?
	- Previous frame's input vector
    THINK OF DISTANCE + DIRECTION
	- Distance from center
	- Distance from border (any border? North,South,East,West?)
	- Distance from nearest obstacle
	- Distance from nearest player/ai
  Output:
	- Vector of player input 
	- [1 1 0 1] which maps to WASD
