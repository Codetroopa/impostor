Machine Learning Model for AI:
  Feature Set:
	- Position on map (x, y)
	- Time (ms? 10ms? every frame?)  // I don't think we need this. Time elapsed should be independent of whether the AI moves or not
	- Time since last direction change?
	- Time while in motion / stationary?
	- Previous frame's input vector  // I don't think we need this. The player's input gets inferred by other features
	- Is player stationary?
    THINK OF DISTANCE + DIRECTION (distance of player - distance of object)
	- Distance from center
	- Distance from border (any border? North,South,East,West?)
	- Distance from nearest obstacle
	- Distance from nearest player/ai
  Output:
	- Vector of player input 
	- [0 1 0 1] which maps to WASD
